  You may need to remove CMakeCache.txt

2. Extract source and enter the extracted directory, then:
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/usr' -DLIBEXEC_DIR='/usr/libexec'
make

Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and LIBEXEC_DIR if you want to install
in different directories.

3. If you have previous version installed, then need to:
make uninstall_schemas

4. Install and register schemas:
sudo make install
make install_schemas


5. Use iBus UI or run ibus-setup to add ibus-chewing.

6. Restart iBus and Enjoy!
